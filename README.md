# Emby Theater Maximise 
## Instead of fullscreen
Replace the main.js file with the given file to enable maximise function instead of fullscreen on the emby theater app

It gets very annoying that the emby theater app on windows goes full screen when maximised, and hides the taskbar, which makes switching to other apps a pain. These changes fixes the problem.

## How to?
Download the file, replace the main.js file in %appdata%\Emby-Theater\system\electronapp\AppData\Roaming\Emby-Theater\system\electronapp with the main.js file provided here.
